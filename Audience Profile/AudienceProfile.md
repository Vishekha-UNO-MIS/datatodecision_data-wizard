## Audience Profile
Below are the details regarding the Organization, Client's information and other details of the Organization on which our study analysis depends.

### Organization Details
Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of the National Park Service. In 1966, the National Monument first began as a part of the National Register of Historic Places. The National Monument is 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. Under the Homestead Act, the site is one of the most successful lands claimed sites. HOME allows qualified volunteers to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation, and improvement of the property. As a result, more than 270 million acres of land were given to the volunteers. This led to drastic changes in the quality of land which was much needed. The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking a tour of the interactive museum of the American homesteading. The Homestead Act holds significance for the westward expansion of the United States. It allows any volunteer to claim the land in exchange for taking care of it, keeping it free from contamination, and persuading people to take the best care of the land they live in. The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and the lives of the people by preserving our resources for future generations.

### Sociodemographic
#### Training & Education
In 1972, the U.S. government introduced the Clean Water Act (CWA) to conserve the quality of surface water. This act was introduced to make sure that all sources of surface water like lakes, streams, and rivers are regulated. From this point onward, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the water quality standards and requirements. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, “the CWA made it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained”. For instance, the EPA set the threshold for the acceptable amount of pollutants and wastewater standards for the industry.

Acknowledge the importance of water quality, many park rangers and water quality professionals have been monitoring the quality of surface water throughout the country. By monitoring water quality, the researchers can identify specific contaminations, trends, and whether the water meets EPA standards. To identify contaminations, the researchers need to look at various chemical constituents like phosphorus, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen. Some of the common factors that lead to water pollution are “the number of people living in a watershed, how the land is used (agriculture, forested, urbanized, etc.) and the everyday behavior of the population”. Also, the researchers need to look at some other components like the streamflow, temperature, pH level, turbidity, total solids, conductivity, total alkalinity, and Fecal bacteria. The combinations of all these measurements help pinpoint the source of the contamination. For instance, if the source of the contamination is from industrial discharge, the researchers can expect to have unusual measurements on the temperature, the conductivity, the total solids, the toxics, and the pH level. In general, the water temperature from upstream to downstream shouldn’t change too drastically so it would be a good signal to let the researchers know that the water might be contaminated.

#### Organization Values/ Mission/Goals
The ultimate goal of the Homestead Act is to provide free land for volunteers in exchange for their residence, cultivation, and improvement of the land. This agenda helps maximized the use of natural lands and resources. Volunteers received land for free to live in and at the same time the natural resources, the land, and the water habitats were protected from many contaminations. Furthermore, volunteers received more than 10 percent of the land in the US to achieve the ultimate Homestead goal and fulfill their American dreams. The goal is to achieve a diverse settlement, agricultural benefits and huge advancement in the field of agriculture. Building nature, renewing our resources to the best for mankind and for future generations to live in.

### Communities (served by organization)

Homestead monitos couple of parameters such as 	
* Air
* Water
* WildLife
* Fire Ecology
* Land Cover

All the monitoring reports are available and are open to the public. This group’s main goal is to monitor those factors mentioned above and publish them and make it available to  the public. The reports available online most of them are visible to the public, and they do mention the visibility  in all the reports.

Based on their reports following are the list of communities which are benefited by their mission:

* Aquatic Society
* Immigrants who come to the  U.S.A  for fulfilling their dream
* Communities which are looking for any livelihood 
* Natural Resources which are in the fear of contamination, the authorities do read the reports and decide which lands need to be  protected from being contaminated
* The reports are also available to various government agencies who take action based on their reports
