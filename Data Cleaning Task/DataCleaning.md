## Data Set Description

The Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), which is a unit of the National Park System, commemorates passage of the Homestead Act of 1862. Through this act, any qualified person can claim up to 160 acres of federally owned land in exchange for five years of residence and a promise to cultivate and take proper care of the land.

HOME's another initiative is to invite students or any other group of people wanting to participate, monitoring water quality in the park. We received data set from our client Jesse Bolli, Resource Management Specialist at HOME, where observations were recorded regarding water quality in the park.

The data set consist of 1061 rows and 53 columns. Data set includes data regarding water quality such as Precipitation Current Day, Water Temperature, pH level of the water, Conductivity, Turbidity, Nitrates, Total Phosphate, Alkalinity Average etc. The data set has observations that were recorded from the year 2002 till 2016.
