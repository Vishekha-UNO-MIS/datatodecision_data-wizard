## Overview

As per our data research questions, we have filtered our dataset from the year 2013 to the year 2017. We could see how the water quality between the two sites changes in these 5 years. We have removed some unnecessary columns and rows to ensure the rationality about the data cleaning. We have combined the day, month, and year column into a single column named Date. We have simplified the column name to make it easier to use. Additionally, we have filled the mean value for temperature in the missing location as the temperature will not vary too much for a given season.  In the column ObservationSite, same name has written in different patterns, so we changed it into single pattern (north -> North, west -> West). Also, we have converted all decimal values to 2 decimal points so that it will be easier to read and use the data.

These are the preliminary steps to create MasterWaterQualityEntryAdded.xlsx:  
- Filled in Temperature and Precipitation by using extra spreadsheets from Jesse  
- Calculated the mean for pH, Conductivity, and DissolvedOxygen columns  
- Filled empty cells of pH, Conductivity, and Dissolved columns with the calculated means


## Instructions

First in the R file we read the Excel file, you need to change the path to match up with the directory where the excel file is located.
Change the Path, next we filter for the year 2012 and 2018. Third step unnecessary columns are removed. Fourth step all header names are renamed to remain consistent.
Finally, once the data set has all the necessary fields, we need some rows which have NV value they are replaced with NA.  Few values are converted to numeric and using the
write.csv command we store the file in CSV format.

For Replication:
Please download this R file and change the path for the excel sheet and after running the R code we can get the revised dataset which is cleaned and can be used for further analysis.


## R source code  

```install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

##Import csv file, skip the first 2 rows, and use the 3rd row as header
my_data<-read_excel("C:/Users/hatha/Desktop/DataExploration/MasterWaterQualityEntryAdded.xlsx",sheet="Sheet1", skip = 2,col_types =NULL ,col_names = TRUE)

##Remove the first row since it is a unit row
dataset <- my_data [-c (1),]

##Filter 2013-2017 data
newdata1<- subset(dataset,dataset$Year>2012 & dataset$Year<2018)

##Combine Day, Month, & Year columns into Date column
newdata1$Date <- as.Date(with(newdata1, paste(Year, Month, Day,sep="-")), "%Y-%m-%d")

##Remove unnecessary columns
newdata2<-newdata1[,c(4,5,6,8,10,11,12,13,17,24,25,46,47,50,53)]

##Rename header names
names (newdata2)[2]<- "ObservationSite"
names (newdata2)[3]<- "TempF"
names (newdata2)[4]<- "Precipitation"
names (newdata2)[5]<- "WaterTemp"
names (newdata2)[8]<- "DissolvedOxygen"
names (newdata2)[10]<- "FloatAverage"
names (newdata2)[13]<- "Phosphates"
names (newdata2)[14]<- "Sulfate"
names (newdata2)[15]<- "Alkalinity"


##Capitalized first letter in observation site

capFirst<- function(s){
  + paste(toupper(substring(s, 1, 1)), substring(s, 2), sep = "")
  + }
newdata2$ObservationSite<-capFirst(newdata2$ObservationSite)


##Replaced NA with the mean value of Water temp

data1<-newdata2
data1$WaterTemp= as.numeric(as.character(data1$WaterTemp))
data1$WaterTemp[which(is.na(data1$WaterTemp))]<-mean(data1$WaterTemp,na.rm= TRUE)

data1<-newdata2
data1$WaterTemp= as.numeric(as.character(data1$WaterTemp))
data1$WaterTemp[which(is.na(data1$WaterTemp))]<-mean(data1$WaterTemp,na.rm= TRUE)

##Convert the data in numeric form and upto 2 decimal points
data1$WaterTemp= as.numeric(as.character(data1$WaterTemp))
data1$WaterTemp<-round(data1$WaterTemp,2)

data1$TempF=as.numeric(as.character(data1$TempF))
data1$TempF<-round(data1$TempF,2)

data1$Precipitation=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Precipitation))
data1$Precipitation<-round(data1$Precipitation,2)

data1$pH=as.numeric(as.character(data1$pH))
data1$pH<-round(data1$pH,2)

data1$Conductivity=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Conductivity))
data1$Conductivity<-round(data1$Conductivity,2)

data1$DissolvedOxygen=as.numeric(as.character(data1$DissolvedOxygen))
data1$DissolvedOxygen<-round(data1$DissolvedOxygen,2)

data1$Turbidity=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Turbidity))
data1$Turbidity<-round(data1$Turbidity,2)

data1$FloatAverage=as.numeric(as.character(data1$FloatAverage))
data1$FloatAverage<-round(data1$FloatAverage,2)

data1$Velocity=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Velocity))
data1$Velocity<-round(data1$Velocity,2)

data1$Nitrates=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Nitrates))
data1$Nitrates<-round(data1$Nitrates,2)

data1$Phosphates=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Phosphates))
data1$Phosphates<-round(data1$Phosphates,2)

data1$Sulfate=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Sulfate))
data1$Sulfate<-round(data1$Sulfate,2)

data1$Alkalinity=as.numeric(as.character(data1$Alkalinity))
data1$Alkalinity<-round(data1$Alkalinity,2)

##Write Function
write.csv(data1,"C:/Users/hatha/Desktop/DataExploration/reviseddata.csv")
```



## Next step

For next step, we will apply this same data cleaning processes for the data from 2002 to 2012. Furthermore, we will reach out to Jesse to see if he has extra data about the turbidity, float average, nitrates, phosphates, alkalinity.
