    <h1> Background</h1>
    <p>
        Homestead Act has been one of the most important legislation in the United States. The very first Homestead was claimed in Brownville, Nebraska by a resident of Ohio name Daniel Freeman in the year 1863. He is the first homesteader in the nation. Daniel served more than 1000 acres and became one of the prominent residents of Gage County. He proposed the idea of memorizing the place he lived in, on his name. Soon after his death, the residents of Beatrice started the agenda of preserving his homestead as National park. Initially, the proposal got rejected by the officials but in the year 1934, the resident of Beatrice organized National Homestead Park Association to continue the deed as performed by The Daniel. [1]

        The Association could not do much due to funds issue and soon after America entered World War II the park visitation and development was suspended. [1]

        However, in the year 1950, the national park service (NPS) acquired the park and built the visitor center. Gradually there was some positive progress towards the development and in the year 1981, the National Monument had five permanent employees, one part-time and a few seasonal employees. [1]

        In the 1970s and 1980s seasonal rangers demonstrated the history of the Homestead Act. By the early 1990s, the Homestead Act began to move to other states in the country. [1]

    <h1> Data Source and Processing</h1>
    <p>
        HOME's another initiative is to invite students or any other group of people wanting to participate, monitoring water quality in the park. We received data set from our client Jesse Bolli, Resource Management Specialist at HOME, where observations were recorded regarding water quality in the park.
        The data set consist of 1061 rows and 53 columns. Data set includes data regarding water quality such as Precipitation Current Day, Water Temperature, pH level of the water, Conductivity, Turbidity, Nitrates, Total Phosphate, Alkalinity Average etc. The data set has observations that were recorded from the year 2002 till 2016.
    </p>
    <h2> Processing</h2>
    <p>
        As per our data research questions, we have filtered our dataset from the year 2013 to the year 2017. We could see how the water quality between the two sites changes in these 5 years. We have removed some unnecessary columns and rows to ensure the rationality about the data cleaning.
        We have combined the day, month, and year column into a single column named Date. We have simplified the column name to make it easier to use. Additionally, we have filled the mean value for temperature in the missing location as the temperature will not vary too much for a given season. In the column ObservationSite, same name has written in different patterns, so we changed it into single pattern (north -> North, west -> West). Also, we have converted all decimal values to two decimal points so that it will be easier to read and use the data.

<h1> Research Questions </h1>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li> Question No.1 is important because we want to check if there was contamination water (human or animal waste) flowing in the water stream. </li>


        <li> Question No.2 is the follow up question to the first question and it helps identify the changes in E.Coli colonies between the North and West sites. </li>


        <li> Question No.3 is to cover other types of water contamination (sediments from erosion, waste discharge, algae growth, sodium, chloride, oil,etc.) by looking at the Turbidity and Conductivity between the North and West sites. </li>


        <li> Question No. 4 in a sense is important to figure out what Nutrient factors such as Alkalinity or Dissolved oxygen affect the quality in both North and West Site. Since, the dissolved oxygen.Dissolved oxygen in surface water is used by all forms of aquatic life; therefore, this constituent typically is measured to assess the "health" of lakes and streams.Also, the Alkalinity has  the capacity of water to resist changes in pH that would make the water more acidic and therefore it would be interesting to know how these factors affect pH level of water </li>

    <h1>Audience Targets </h1>
    <p>
        Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of the National Park Service. In 1966, the National Monument first began as a part of the National Register of Historic Places.
        The National Monument is 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. Under the Homestead Act, the site is one of the most successful lands claimed sites.
        HOME allows qualified volunteers to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation, and improvement of the property.
        As a result, more than 270 million acres of land were given to the volunteers. This led to drastic changes in the quality of land which was much needed. The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking a tour of the interactive museum of the American homesteading.
        The Homestead Act holds significance for the westward expansion of the United States. It allows any volunteer to claim the land in exchange for taking care of it, keeping it free from contamination, and persuading people to take the best care of the land they live in.
        The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and the lives of the people by preserving our resources for future generations.

<h1> Analysis </h1>
<p>
    A simple linear regression was applied to predict a continuous outcome variable (y)  which pH value of water in this case based on one single predictor variable (x) which is level of Dissolved Oxygen in water in this case for North Site.
</p>
<p>   The outcome of linear regression model was plotted using ggplot which provides us with the above mentioned plot.
</p>
<p>
   <h2> The conclusions so drawn from ggplots are:- </h2>



    1.Residual Vs Fitted: Used to check the linear relationship assumptions. A horizontal line, without distinct patterns is an indication for a linear relationship, which is good. In this case there is almost no pattern in the residual plot. This suggests that we cannot assume linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome variables.

&nbsp;

    2. Normal Q-Q: Used to examine whether the residuals are normally distributed. It’s good if residuals points follow the straight dashed line. In this case many observations are far away from the expected line therefore not normally distributed.

&nbsp;

    3. Standardized Residual Plot: The plot shows if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors. It’s good if we see a horizontal line with equally spread points. In this case, this is not the case. It can be seen that the variability (variances) of the residual points is haphazard
with the value of the fitted outcome variable, suggesting no non-constant variances in the residuals errors.


4. Residue Vs Leverage: Used to identify influential cases, that is extreme values that might influence the regression results when included or excluded from the analysis. In this case the two observations 186 and 188 show high leverage point and should be well investigated.

    For the two plots below, we are trying to look at the changes in Turbidity/Conductivity between the North and West sites. By using geom point, we can see the changes when the points go up and down. We also faceted the plots based on the years to make sure that we are only comparing the monthly differences of a specific year. Finally, we distinguished the two sites with color.
    To interpret these plots, we need to look at the specific month and see if the clusters of points are close to each other which means there is not much of a difference between the two sites. In a perfect world, we expect the cluster of points to lay over each other which means there are no differences. For instance, by looking at September 2015 of the first plot, we can tell that there is a big difference in measurements between the two sites. Additionally, a typical freshwater stream will be between 150 and 500 µhos/cm.
    Overall, the Conductivity between the North and the West sites didn’t change much. However, the September of 2015 had a big difference between the 2 sites. This could be due to oil contaminated water flowing through rainy days. As for Turbidity, the plot indicates higher turbidity during rainy season during fall. For 2015, we are missing data from June to December which explained why there is a gap in our plot.
